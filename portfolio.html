<P>Before we go to where I study and What I do before furhter study let's go to my personal life first,I'm born on 9th January 1999 at Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab Kota Bharu,Kelantan and live there more than 20 years.

Both of my parents I considers as the most valuable person in my life where my mom as my mentor to be a nice person and my dad as an example to work hard and focus to get what you want.Family is the most important thing for me.Ok enough about my personal life I don't have favourite food etc everything about cliche things is depends on mood, let's go to my past.</p>
